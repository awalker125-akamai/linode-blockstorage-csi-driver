# Observability with Grafana Dashboard

This document explains how to use the `grafana-dashboard` make target to install and configure observability tools, including Prometheus and Grafana, on your Kubernetes cluster. The setup uses Helm charts to install Prometheus and Grafana, provides a Prometheus data source, and applies a Grafana dashboard configuration.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your local machine:
- **Kubernetes**: A running Kubernetes cluster.
- **kubectl**: To manage the cluster.
- **Helm**: To install and manage Helm charts for Prometheus and Grafana.

You should also have access to the Kubernetes cluster's kubeconfig file (`test-cluster-kubeconfig.yaml`), which will be used for running the make target.

## Steps to Install the Grafana Dashboard

### 1. Build and Set Up the Cluster (Optional)
If you havenâ€™t already set up your Kubernetes cluster with the necessary CSI driver and Prometheus metrics services, you can do so by running the following command:
```bash
make mgmt-and-capl-cluster
```
This command creates a management cluster and CAPL (Cluster API for Linode) cluster, installs the Linode CSI driver, and applies the necessary configurations to expose the CSI metrics.

### 2. Run the Grafana Dashboard Setup
The make target `grafana-dashboard` will install Prometheus and Grafana in a Kubernetes namespace (`monitoring` by default) and configure a Grafana dashboard from a local JSON file. To execute this setup, run:

```bash
make grafana-dashboard
```

### 3. What Happens During the Setup?

- **Node Scheduling**: The script checks whether worker nodes exist in the cluster. If no worker nodes are found, it untaints the control-plane nodes to allow Prometheus and Grafana to be scheduled.

- **Helm Repository Setup**: Helm repositories for Prometheus and Grafana are added if not already present.

- **Prometheus Installation**: The `prometheus` Helm chart is installed (or upgraded) in the monitoring namespace. It scrapes metrics from the CSI driver and other services.

- **Grafana Installation**: The `grafana` Helm chart is installed (or upgraded) in the same namespace, with Prometheus set as the data source.

- **Dashboard ConfigMap**: The script uploads the Grafana dashboard configuration stored locally in `docs/dashboard.json` into a Kubernetes ConfigMap, ensuring the dashboard is automatically loaded into Grafana.

- **Port Forwarding**: The script port-forwards the Grafana service to `localhost:3000`, allowing you to access the Grafana dashboard on your local machine.

### 4. Accessing the Grafana Dashboard

Once the setup is complete, open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

Log in using the following credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

These details can be customized via the `install-monitoring-tools.sh` script if needed. 

To understand the graphs and the metrics, go through the [Metrics Documentation](metrics-documentation.md).

### 5. Stopping the Port Forwarding

To stop the Grafana port forwarding, run:
```bash
kill <PID>
```
Replace `<PID>` with the process ID provided by the script during the setup.

## Customizing the Setup

- **Namespace**: The default namespace for the observability tools is `monitoring`. You can modify this by editing the `install-monitoring-tools.sh` script and changing the `NAMESPACE` variable.

- **Grafana Dashboard Configuration**: The dashboard configuration is stored in `docs/dashboard.json`. To apply a different dashboard, replace the contents of this file before running the make target.

- **Prometheus Data Source**: The default data source is Prometheus, as defined in the Helm chart configuration. If you wish to use a different data source, modify the `helm upgrade` command in `install-monitoring-tools.sh`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the installation process, check the logs and status of the Prometheus and Grafana pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
kubectl logs <prometheus-pod-name> -n monitoring
kubectl logs <grafana-pod-name> -n monitoring
```

This setup provides a quick and easy way to enable observability using Grafana dashboards, ensuring that you have visibility into your Kubernetes cluster and CSI driver operations.
